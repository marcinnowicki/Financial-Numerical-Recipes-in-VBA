But if you prefer VBA for coding financial applications please check this repository.

Some of the advantages of this project is that you may find a way how to do matrix multiplication purely in VBA without using sheet. Also each function has its own testing macro. This gives two advantages. First you may check if the function realy works. The second is timing. Each testing measures the time of execution. Some code I tested in both languages, ie C++ and VBA. Apparently VBA is not much slower than C++.
